This file is notes taken while reading the paper, about what we need to focus on.

1. We need to plot data points from the file, and also plot the best-fit normal, poisson, and NBD distributions of those points, for various graphs.
2. The last para of pg 3 and the first para of pg 4 give some constraints for which data points we should ignore. We will need to replicate all that before we get to the plotting part in code. These paragraphs are pasted at the end of this document, at the *.
3. For the above, there are various characteristics of collisions which we need to understand how to extract from tehe info given in the data file. These characteristics are: 
p_T (transverse momentum), eta (pseudorapidity), radial vertex position.
